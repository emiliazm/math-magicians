## Prerequisites

In the previous project, you worked on the setup of a React application using Create React App (CRA), now you should:

- Delete all the boilerplate from CRA (text, images, styles).
- Create a directory called components.
- Inside components, create a new Calculator.js file.
- Create a website consisting of 3 pages: Home, Calculator, and Quote.
- Add your own styles to improve the look and feel.
- For every page, you should create a route.
- Make sure that navigation links for all 3 routes are displayed on each page.
- Use React Router to make the routes work.
- Set up React Testing Library.
- Write unit tests for the files operate.js and calculate.js using Jest.
- Create unit tests for all React components.
  - Use Jest snapshots to test the components.
  - Use React Testing Library to simulate user interaction.
- Run your full tests suite using Jest. All tests should pass.
